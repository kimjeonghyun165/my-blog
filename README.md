# My Mini Blog with Next.js

**Currently in Progress: Code Optimization and Remote MDX Integration.**

## Overview

This mini blog is my hobby project, a front-end endeavor created to explore and learn Next.js, a powerful React framework. It showcases my passion for front-end development and serves as a playground for experimenting with various technologies.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14:** Utilizing the latest version of Next.js to build a modern and efficient web application.
- **TypeScript & JavaScript:** Leveraging TypeScript for type safety and enhancing the development experience, alongside JavaScript for dynamic scripting.

- **MDX (Markdown + JSX):** Writing blog posts using MDX, a format that combines the simplicity of Markdown with the flexibility of JSX, allowing for the seamless integration of React components.

- **Tailwind CSS:** Implementing a custom and responsive design with the help of Tailwind CSS, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent layout.

- **DaisyUI:** Incorporating DaisyUI components to enhance the user interface and user experience.

- **Dark Mode:** Implementing a dark mode feature to offer users the option for a comfortable viewing experience in low-light environments.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally and explore the code:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-mini-blog.git
   cd your-mini-blog

   ```

2. **run the development server::**

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
